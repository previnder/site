**Hi I’m Previnder,** a software developer from Sri Lanka (I write Go and Javascript and Typescript, for the most part). Currently, I’m working as a freelance developer while also working on my non-profit social networking platform, [Discuit](https://discuit.org/), which is also [open-source](https://github.com/discuitnet/discuit).

On this website, I write about programming, technology, design, and just about anything that interests me.

You can find me also on: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/previnder.com), [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/itsprevinder), and [Github](https://github.com/previnder). To contact me directly, feel free to send me an email at hello@previnder.com.
